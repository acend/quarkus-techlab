  Writing your own Quarkus Extension.

## Lab Content

The simple extension provides a very basic servlet to expose some application information. The required code for exposing
this information will be wrapped in a quarkus extension. The extension will also provide an integration in the Quarkus Dev UI.

This extension will be used in another application as dependency to show its functionality.


## Quarkus Application Bootstrap

The bootstrapping of a Quarkus application takes place in three distinct bootstrap phases:

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

* **Augmentation.** During the build time, the Quarkus extensions will load and scan your applicationâ€™s bytecode
(including the dependencies) and configuration. At this stage, the extension can read configuration files, scan classes
for specific annotations, etc. Once all the metadata has been collected, the extensions can pre-process the libraries
bootstrap actions like your ORM, DI or REST controllers configurations. The result of the bootstrap is directly recorded
into bytecode and will be part of your final application package.

* **Static Init.** During the run time, Quarkus will execute first a static init method which contains some extensions
actions/configurations. When you will do your native packaging, this static method will be pre-processed during the
build time and the objects it has generated will be serialized into the final native executable, so the initialization
code will not be executed in the native mode (imagine you execute a Fibonacci function during this phase, the result of
the computation will be directly recorded in the native executable). When running the application in JVM mode, this
static init phase is executed at the start of the application.

* **Runtime Init.** Well nothing fancy here, we do classic run time code execution. So, the more code you run during
the two phases above, the faster your application will start.
