# Deployment using Tekton 

Tekton is a Kubernetes-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) framework that enables you to create containerized, composable, and configurable workloads declaratively through CRDs. 
In this section we are going to define and create pipelines using Tekton to apply our defined manifests, build and deploy our images.
